# Distributed Playground

This is a simple playground with two applications (earth, moon) at the moment. This is a place to mess around with distributed concepts without the overhead of complex systems. Currently these are setup to instantly cluster via [libcluster](https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster) using [Gossip](https://hexdocs.pm/libcluster/Cluster.Strategy.Gossip.html).
